# Spotify Kaggle Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook used to analyze the Spotify dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to analyze the Spotify dataset and create a linear regression model to predict the reputation of the songs based on a set of given features.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to understand the relationships between different features of the songs and their reputation, and to build a predictive model using linear regression.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/spotify-data-from-pyspark-course).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data, identify correlations, and visualize relationships between features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features for the linear regression model.
4. **Model Building**: Build a linear regression model using the selected features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results and Findings

The linear regression model was able to predict the reputation of songs with a reasonable accuracy. The analysis helped identify the most significant features that influence a song's reputation on Spotify.
